It can also be used to save and load groups of files which may be useful even for files part of a project.\n\n\nCurrent features:\n\n\n\n\nAdd/remove/open file(s) in favorites.\n\n\nOptionally store files in groups and open entire groups.\n\n\nToggle project specific favorites.\n\n\nAllow specifying an alias for your favorite file(s).\n\n\n\n\nCommands\n\ue157\n\n\nAll commands are accessible via the command palette.\n\n\nFavorite Files: Open File\n\ue157\n\n\nProvides a quick list to select one of your favorite files to open, or a group of favorite files. Optionally (if \nalways_ask_alias\n is \ntrue\n), will prompt for a an alias for the file.\n\n\nFavorite Files: Add File\n\ue157\n\n\nAdds the current opened file, or all the files in the current window group, to your favorites.  An input panel will be opened so you can decide whether you want to save it normally or to a group.\n\n\nFavorite Files: Remove File\n\ue157\n\n\nRemove a favorite file form your list or a group of favorite files.\n\n\nFavorite Files: Edit File Alias\n\ue157\n\n\nEdit a file's alias.  By default, the file will be listed in menus with it's actual file name, but this can be modified for a better, easier to remember name if needed. To revert the alias back to its original, true file name, simply change the alias to an empty string.\n\n\nFavorite Files: Toggle Per Project\n\ue157\n\n\nAllows saving per project favorites. Per projects must be toggled on for each project you are in.  You can toggle back and forth between per project and global favorites.  You cannot switch to per project favorites if you do not have a project file saved.  Save your current window configuration to a project file, and your per project favorites list will be saved in the same location.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf you have no need for per project favorites, you can completely disable the command in your settings file with the \nenable_per_projects\n setting.\n\n\n\n\nFavorite Files: Clean Orphaned Favorites\n\ue157\n\n\nCleans out favorites in your list that no longer exist.\n\n\nSettings\n\ue157\n\n\nFavorite files has only a couple of settings.\n\n\nenable_per_projects\n\ue157\n\n\nEnables the per project toggling ability.  For more info, see: \nFavorite Files: Toggle Per Project\n.\n\n\n    \n// Enable ability for per project favorites .\n\n    \n// Per Projects must be toggled on for each project you are in.\n\n    \n// You can toggle back and forth between per project and global favorites.\n\n    \nenable_per_projects\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nuse_sub_notify\n\ue157\n\n\nEnables use of \nSubNotify\n notifications.\n\n\n    \n// Use subnotify if available\n\n    \nuse_sub_notify\n:\n \ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\nalways_ask_alias\n\ue157\n\n\nWhen adding a single file to favorites, the user will always be prompted to provide an alias.\n\n\n    \n// Prompt for a file alias every time you add a single file.\n\n    \nalways_ask_alias\n:\n \nfalse",
